A testNG XMl file will allow you to prepare your test execution process when you have many selenium classes

every xml file start with a tag called <suite></suite>
We prefer having only 1 <suite></suite> tag
verbose = how detailed should be log of output on Console when a test case is executed
verbose = selenium test case execution log seen on console output
Inside suite we have to write the tests to be executed
Inside the <test> tag we will write classes of our packages that we have to run
<classes> includes <class> tag
<class></class> includes the naem of package and class to be executed
